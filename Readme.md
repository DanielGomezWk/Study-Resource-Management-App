Project Description:
Studying and socializing are critical to the success of Penn State students. This
application bridges the gap between students and their community resources. It provides 
an interactive social network that allows students to communicate with and meet up with
their peers in order to study and participate in extracurricular activities. This 
application will create a more supportive and engaged campus community.
